# mini-project



This is the first project of this bootcamp.

It consist of a really simple game of "guess the number". There are few Input where the player enter the range, the guessed number, the oportunities, etc.. 

I imported the library random and I divided the code in differents functions to make it easier to understand and manipulate.
